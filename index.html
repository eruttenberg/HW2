<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Eric Ruttenberg and this is my Homework 2 assignment for Software Development and Design.
I am a senior at the University of Iowa, majoring in business analytics and information systems. When I'm not studying, I enjoy playing sports
and watching movies, as well as reading and writing. </p>

<p>	I am a huge Chicago sports fan, especially of the Chicago Cubs. This season has been an absolute blast finally having a good team to cheer for. My favorite player is Kyle Hendricks.
I keep telling people he's the new Maddux, so hopefully he doesn't let me down.  
I also enjoy watching the Bears, Bulls and Blackhawks, which, lately, has been slightly more productive. </p>
<p>	This past summer I interned at American Hotel Register in the Transportation department. It was a great company to work for and I learned a lot about not 
only transportation and logistics, but also about office life in general. If all goes well, I'll be back with them in a full time capacity this coming summer.
</p>
<h2> My favorite movies </h2>
<p> I mentioned earlier that I really like to watch movies in my free time. Here's a list of some of my favorites: </p>
<li> Se7en </li>
<li> The Silence of the Lambs </li>
<li> Memento </li>
<li> Margin Call </li>
<li> Whiplash </li>
<li> Gone Girl </li>
<li> This is the End </li>
